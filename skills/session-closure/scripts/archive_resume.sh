# archive_resume.sh - Archive CLAUDE_RESUME.md with timestamp
# Part of session-closure skill v1.3.5
#
# Usage: ./archive_resume.sh [PROJECT_ROOT] [--dry-run]
#
# Arguments:
#   PROJECT_ROOT - Path to project root directory (defaults to current directory)
#                  Should contain CLAUDE.md to verify it's a project root
#
# Behavior:
# - If CLAUDE_RESUME.md is tracked in git: Skip archiving (git history is archive)
# - If CLAUDE_RESUME.md doesn't exist: Skip archiving (nothing to archive)
# - Otherwise: Move to archives/CLAUDE_RESUME/<timestamp>.md
#
# Exit codes:
# 0 - Success (archived or skipped appropriately)
# 1 - Error
